## The Expanse: Osiris Reborn Trainer — gravity bends, choice remains

Space is never silent.
In **The Expanse: Osiris Reborn**, every corridor hums with tension, every decision carries mass. The **Trainer** is not here to overpower that weight—but to help you redistribute it. A stabilizer. A thruster correction. A quiet hand on the console when systems grow unforgiving.

This tool is crafted for players who want tactical freedom: testing builds, surviving harsh encounters, or simply experiencing the narrative without constant attrition.
